    Content: Clinical trials are a critical, but challenging, necessity in providing
      healthcare to patients. They are often expensive, difficult for patients
      to access, and limited in their cohort diversity. Additionally, there is
      often a gap in the continuation of care as patients transition from trials
      back to a standard healthcare setting. This webinar brings together five
      industry leaders to provide their perspectives on how digital tools will
      ease some of the pain points in clinical trials and lead to the
      improvement in patient care.
