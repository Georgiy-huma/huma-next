  necessity in providing healthcare to patients. They are often expensive,
  difficult for patients to access, and limited in their cohort diversity.
  Additionally, there is often a gap in the continuation of care as patients
  transition from trials back to a standard healthcare setting. This webinar
  brings together five industry leaders to provide their perspectives on how
  digital tools will ease some of the pain points in clinical trials and lead to
  the improvement in patient care. [huma.com](huma.com)"
