postContent: "**Clinical** trials are a critical, but challenging, necessity in
  providing healthcare to patients. They are often expensive, difficult for
  patients to access, and limited in their cohort diversity. Additionally, there
  is often a gap in the continuation of care as patients transition from trials
  back to a standard healthcare setting. This webinar brings together five
  industry leaders to provide their perspectives on how digital tools will ease
  some of the pain points in clinical trials and lead to the improvement in
  patient care. [huma.com](huma.com)"
